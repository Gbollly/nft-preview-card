### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<main>Some HTML code I'm proud of</main>
```
```css
.avatar > img {
  float: right;
}
```



### Continued development

I would like to focus moree on the image hover effect styling.



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me to give a clear explanation of image hover effect. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
